# WORDLE

A simple implementation of the game Wordle in C++

The purpose of this game is to guess a 5 letter word in 5 tries, but this implementation
allows n letter words with k tries.

The available words are stored in uppercase, separated by a newline in `words.txt`.

To run this simply compile it with your preferred C++ compiler and run it.
